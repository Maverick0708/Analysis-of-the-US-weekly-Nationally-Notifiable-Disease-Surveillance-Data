### An indepth analysis was done of US weekly Nationally Notifiable Disease Surveillance Data from 1888 to 2013 collected in project Tycho. Link for the data can be found below. The analysis studied most contageous diseases with highest mortality rates and their patterns. Based on the data more indepth analysis was done for the tuberculosis as it was highly contagious and with very high mortality rate. I compiled the populations data for all US states from year 1900-1927 through various sources. The compiled file has been uploaded. This allowed me to perform statewise and analysis and the impact of disease per 1000 of the population to give an idea which states kept mortality rates low even with high case loads. A pdf report has been uploaded to provide a summarisation of the foundings. For complete and detailed analysis with code and findings, a .Rmd file has also been attached.
